Changelog: 
9/23/24:

Tasks:

Finish any changes needed to multiplayer lobby to make it work.
Get the core game loop working of day and night cycles until one group of players win. 
Change the game from 2D to 3D (I was originally following a guide to work on my game loop, but the guide turned out to be horrible so I need to change the game back to 3D to follow my original player experience idea)
Get role assigning working, no abilities or anything yet. Just health and ability to attack someone. 
Get basic day and night working, no scene changes yet. 
Get core game loop working so that day happens for about 3 minutes, then night happens, you get an option to attack someone, then day happens and the results of the night are revealed in text for now. 
I want to get the first person point of view working, but we'll see. For now, the plan is just to have capsules sitting in a room.
Set up heart system in text and player list. 

What was completed:
- Voting is now working wooo! You can use a dropdown to vote and vote out a player (currently doesn't do anything to them)
- Multiplayer is now working! You can join the room and run around! (don't worry about the second capsule attached to your body!)
- Day and night cycles now exist! You can vote in the day and exist in the backrooms in the night! And repeat this infinitely! Yay!
- While the timers are only 10 seconds for debug, the day will be able to be 3 minutes, then voting for around 30 seconds and then night cycle for another 3 minutes.
- First person point of view works, is using a script from asset store. You can run, jump, zoom, and crouch! perfect for inspecting your capsule friends closely!
- Randomizer roles and alignment works! It'll randomize a role and alignment for all players. Right now, it is set so that it can start with just 1 player for debug. This will not be true later, you will need 3 players to even player the game.
